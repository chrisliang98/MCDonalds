We use the flickr API in this website to allow users search photos from flickr.com with a tag that they could enter. It also returns the direct url to the picture which is displayed, and also the original link on flickr.com. The user can also decide whether they want the most popular, most recent, or least recent photos and also the number of photos displayed.
